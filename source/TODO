I can check how behave those merging tools:
 easydiff.app imediff2 mgdiff tkdiff xdiff xxdiff tkdifff
and probably add them to rpmconf.

vimdiff, gvimdiff, meld, diffuse return 0 even if file was not saved
we may handle it some way. check last modification? ask user?

some files are not marked as configuration file (see bash-completation)
we should somehow try to find them too (optionaly of course)
